1. The grading scale seems to change from 2015 to 2024 as shown by the different pie charts.
2. We can see this because the number of violations shoots up as shown in the scatter plot.
3. The number of valid restaurant inspection values is very small in 2015.

(The increase in violations might be because of COVID, we have to see what type of violations have increased in that time frame.)
