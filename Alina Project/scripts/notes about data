notes: 
average score is 23.533, median is 20, and range is 0 - 168 for scores meaning there are more low scores than higher scores 

the distributions of scores is skewed to the right 

from 2018 - 2024, the order of boroughs from least to greatest with the number of retaurants didn't change : staten island, bronx, queens, brooklyn, manhattan 
    - more restaurants most likely means that there is a greater population density in that area compared to others 

the amount of restaurants in each boro stayed pretty similar 




What to look into:
- the size o each borough 
- how the grades recieved varied by year
- how inspection score/ grade varied by borough
- how insception score/ grade varied by zipcode
- the amount of inspections/restarunts in each borough by zipcode

Research question:
how does location factor into the inspection scores recieved?
