notes: 
average score is 23.533, median is 20, and range is 0 - 168 for scores meaning there are more low scores than higher scores 

the distributions of scores is skewed to the right 

from 2018 - 2024, the order of boroughs from least to greatest with the number of retaurants didn't change : staten island, bronx, queens, brooklyn, manhattan 

the amount of restaurants in each boro stayed pretty similar 




look into relationship between inspection grade and year

look into if the inspection grade gotten varies by cuisine

look into if there is a relation between inspection type and critical flag

look into how the different inspection scores vary in each borough by year  

look into the number of violations per bororugh over the years 

look if the number of violations that a restarunt has changes with the years
